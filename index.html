    <h3>Code Nation reasons</h3>
    <p>
      I was interested in joining Code Nation after doing the 3 week develop
      course and absolutley loved it, especially the python and back end
      development. I have always had a keen interest in IT and computers but
      before the develop course I hadn't done anything profressionly in it.
    </p>
    <h3>Targets</h3>
    <p>
      My targets for this course include, improving my coding skills in multiple
      languages, imrproving my team work skills, improving my leadership skills.
      But also I want to improve my organization skills, my creative skills and
      my public speaking. Eventually following the course I'd like to progress
      into a junior developer role whether that be full stack or back end. Then
      ideally in 4-5 years time progressing into a senior role.
